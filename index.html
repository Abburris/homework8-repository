    <h1>Question: How many schools are in the danger zone if a Nuclear power plant in North Carolina were to explode?</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red">Description</h2>
    <p>If a nuclear power plant were to explode, anything within a 50 mile radius would be exposed to some level of radiation. My map depicts the radius of exposure to radiation of a nuclear power plant were to explode, and it shows all of the public schools that would be in the radiation zone. </p>

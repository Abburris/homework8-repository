    <h1>Homework 8: Geoprocessing map</h1>
    <h2>by Abby Burris</h2>
    <h3>Question: Which public schools are in the radius zone if a nuclear power plant in North Carolina were to explode?</h3>
    
    <h3 style="color:rgb(106, 160, 222)">Description</h3>
    <p>If a nuclear power plant were to explode, anything within a 50 mile radius would be exposed to some level of radiation. My map depicts the radius of exposure to radiation if a nuclear power plant were to explode, and it shows all of the public schools that would be in the radiation zone. I created a buffer with a 50 mile radius around each of the nuclear power plants in North Carolina. Then, I did an intersection to find the public schools that were inside of the buffer. </p>
